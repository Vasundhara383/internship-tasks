# Task 3

This directory contains the code which extracts the block details & transaction details of all the blocks (~10M) from 
[ATOMScan](https://atomscan.com) (a blockchain explorer for Cosmos (ATOM)).


## Time required to pull the data

10M (blocks) * 2 (request/block) * 2s (avg. time/request) = **~1 year** (yes, you read it right ðŸ’€)

P.S. [Script](Task%203/Code.py) will ask for the number of requests to proceed with.
