Hi Samyak,

We will need data (commits, developers' details, etc.) for every repo in the following GitLab repositories:
https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos
https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node
https://gitlab.com/NebulousLabs

I have attached the GitHub code I used to get the data from GitHub repositories.

Please keep in mind that an org has multiple repos, you will need to fetch the orgs for the repos before going to the
final step of getting commits data.

I have also attached sample dataset of how the final data should look like.

Regards,
Vasundhara
