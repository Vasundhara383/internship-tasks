# Task 2

This directory contains the code which extracts all the transactions' data (~5M) from 
[Cosmos Network](https://cosmos.network) (a decentralized network of independent, scalable, and interoperable 
blockchains) [API](https://api.cosmos.network).


## Time required to pull the data

5M (blocks) * 1 (request/block) * 1s (avg. time/request) = **~2 months** (yes, you read it right ðŸ’€)

P.S. [Script](Task%202/Code.py) will ask for the number of requests to proceed with.
